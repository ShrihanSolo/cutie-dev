Welcome to **The Cutie** — a bite-sized crossword puzzle you can play every day, right in your browser!  
Think of it as your daily brain-stretch… but cuter. ✨

## ✨ What is The Cutie?
- A **5×5 crossword** — small enough to squeeze in between sips of coffee ☕,  
  but tricky enough to make you feel clever. 😎  
- **Updated daily** with fresh puzzles.  
- Styled with love (and a little bit of CSS magic).  
- Runs entirely in your browser — no accounts, no downloads, just play.

---

## 🎮 Features
- 🗓️ Load today’s puzzle (or pick a date to revisit the archives).  
- 📂 Load your own puzzle JSON files (yes, you can make custom Cuties!).  
- 🔄 Restart anytime if you want a fresh crack at it.  
- ✅ Toggle **Autocheck** to see if you’re on the right track.  
- ✨ Reveal just a cell… or a whole word if you’re really stuck.  
- ⏱️ Built-in timer to race yourself (or your friends).  
- 🖋️ Smooth keyboard navigation, just like the big crosswords.

## 🛠️ Development
This is a static HTML/JS project. To run locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/cutie.git
cd cutie
open index.html
```

Tips for developers:
- Puzzles are JSON files (schema included in `puzzles/` — follow the format to add puzzles).  
- The UI is intentionally minimal and accessible — feel free to improve styles or keyboard behavior.  
- If you add new features, please keep the UI responsive (5×5 should look great on phones).

---

## 🤝 Contributing
PRs, puzzle submissions, and bug reports are welcome. Keep things:
- small and cute,
- accessible,
- and fun.

If you submit puzzles, please include date metadata so they slot into the daily rotation.
